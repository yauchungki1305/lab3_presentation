## Dogs!

Here is a new markdown document for question 7 and question 8. I am
including text as per instructions, and if one needs to write something
why not write about the sweetest pups ever! See the code below to learn
the names of some really great pals!

``` r
best_dogs <- c('Willow', 'Mya', 'Jewel', 'Alba', 'Ziggy')
for (doggo in best_dogs) print((paste(doggo, "is the sweetest doggo!")))
```

    ## [1] "Willow is the sweetest doggo!"
    ## [1] "Mya is the sweetest doggo!"
    ## [1] "Jewel is the sweetest doggo!"
    ## [1] "Alba is the sweetest doggo!"
    ## [1] "Ziggy is the sweetest doggo!"

## Who goes there?

Who is it that is there? Are you having a nice time? I hope youâ€™re
having a noice day. By noice, I mean nice, but pronounced with an extra
fun sound. Cheers!

``` r
x = "Hurrah!"
y = "Coding!"
print(x)
```

    ## [1] "Hurrah!"

``` r
print(y)
```

    ## [1] "Coding!"
